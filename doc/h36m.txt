In Human3.6M there are 5 subjects for training and 2 for validation.
Furthermore in the
A simple yet effective baseline for 3d human pose estimation
they used Stacked Hourglass detection to train the network and
they apply standard normalization to the 2D inputs and 3D outputs
by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
Knowing that the files are divided in;

train_2d.pth.tar: Contains the subjects for the training process in 2D
    (input of the network)
train_2d_ft.pth.tar: Contains the subjects for the training process in 2D
    with the Stacked Hourglass detection (input of the network)
train_3d.pth.tar: Contains the subjects for the training process in 3D
    (output of the network)
test_2d.pth.tar: Contains the subjects for the validation process in 2D.
test_2d_ft.pth.tar: Contains the subjects for the validation process in 2D
    with the Stacked Hourglass detection.
test_3d.pth.tar: Contains the subjects for the validation process in 3D.
stat_3d.pth.tar: Contains the main/std of the 2D inputs and 3D outputs to unnormalize
    the data and calculate MPJPE.
    
You can train the network either with Stacked Hourglass detection or not.
